# Game-of-Life

Concurrent implementation in Scala of John Conway's Game of Life.
This project was part of my 2nd year course, Concurrent Programming, lectured by Bernard Sufrin.
This implementation uses a library called threadcso which can be found here: [threadcso.jar](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/materials16-17/concurrentprogramming/ThreadCSO/)
