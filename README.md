# Game-of-Life

Concurrent implementation in Scala of John Conway's Game of Life.
This project was part of my 2-nd year course at the University of Oxford, Concurrent Programming, lectured by Bernard Sufrin.

This implementation uses a library called threadcso which can be found here: [threadcso.jar](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/materials16-17/concurrentprogramming/ThreadCSO/)

**Note**: this implementation is not meant to be efficient but I believe it to be a very simple and clear concurrent implementation of a cellular automaton
